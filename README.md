# Reach_NFT_System


GOAL:

The Reach NFT System will allow customers to pay and enter a draw to recieve a randomly generated NFT. The creator of the contract will be able to specify how many people can enter, how long the draw takes place, and a mapping for the nft's features. The mapping for unique features will use customer addresses to determine their respective nft features.
